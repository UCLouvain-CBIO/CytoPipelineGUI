# Foreword - Preparation of pipeline results to be visualized

`CytoPipelineGUI` is the companion package of `CytoPipeline`, and is used for
interactive visualization of flow cytometry data pre-processing pipeline 
results. It implements two shiny applications :  

- a shiny app for interactive comparison of flow frames that are the results 
of CytoProcessingSteps of the same or different CytoPipeline experiments.  
It is launched using the following statement: `CytoPipelineCheckApp()` 
(see below);  

- a shiny app for interactive visualization and manual adjustments of scale 
transformation objects. It is launched using the following statement: 
`ScaleTransformApp()` (see below).

In order to be able to show `CytoPipelineGUI` in action, as a pre-requisite 
we need to have created a `CytoPipeline` object, 
defined the different pipeline steps, and run the pipeline until completion,
so that all intermediate results can be found on a cache. 
These preliminary steps are performed by the preparation code below. 

```{r pkg, include = FALSE}
library(CytoPipeline)
library(CytoPipelineGUI)
library(patchwork)
```

```{r preparation, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# raw data
rawDataDir <- system.file("extdata", package = "CytoPipeline")
sampleFiles <- file.path(rawDataDir, list.files(rawDataDir,
                                                pattern = "Donor"))
# output files
workDir <- suppressMessages(base::tempdir())
# pipeline configuration files (in json)
jsonDir <- rawDataDir

# creation of CytoPipeline objects

pipL_PeacoQC <-
  CytoPipeline(file.path(jsonDir, "OMIP021_PeacoQC_pipeline.json"),
               experimentName = "OMIP021_PeacoQC",
               sampleFiles = sampleFiles)

pipL_flowAI <-
  CytoPipeline(file.path(jsonDir, "OMIP021_flowAI_pipeline.json"),
               experimentName = "OMIP021_flowAI",
               sampleFiles = sampleFiles)

# execute PeacoQC pipeline
suppressWarnings(execute(pipL_PeacoQC, rmCache = TRUE, path = workDir))

# execute flowAI pipeline
suppressWarnings(execute(pipL_flowAI, rmCache = TRUE, path = workDir))
```


If you are unfamiliar with `CytoPipeline` package, and you would like to 
know more about these steps, it is advised that you read 
the `CytoPipeline` vignette, and/or that you watch the videos illustrating 
the `CytoPipeline` suite, which are accessible 
through links included in the `Demo.Rmd` vignette.



# Introduction

The visualization tools shown here are demonstrated on the results 
of two different previously run `CytoPipeline` objects. 
These flow cytometry pre-processing pipeline are described in details
in the `CytoPipeline` vignette. Here below is a short summary 
of the illustrating dataset, as well as the pipeline steps.


## Example dataset (more details in CytoPipeline vignette)
The example dataset that will be used throughout this vignette is derived from 
a reference public dataset accompanying the OMIP-021 (Optimized Multicolor 
Immunofluorescence Panel 021) article [@Gherardin2014-pj].  

A sub-sample of this public dataset is built-in in the `CytoPipeline` 
package, as the OMIP021 dataset. 
See the `MakeOMIP021Samples.R` script for more details 
on how the `OMIP021` dataset was created. This script is to be found 
in the `script` subdirectory in the `CytoPipeline` package installation path.

## Example of pre-processing and QC pipelines (more details in CytoPipeline vignette)
In our example pipeline, we assumed that we wanted to pre-process 
the two samples of the `OMIP021` dataset, and that we wanted to compare 
what we would obtain when pre-processing these files 
using two different QC methods.    

In the first pre-processing pipeline, we used the `flowAI` QC method 
[@Monaco2016-vo], while in the second pipeline, we used the `PeacoQC` method 
[@Emmaneel2021-xy]. 

In both pipelines, the first part consisted in estimating appropriate scale
transformation functions for all channels present in the sample `flowFrame`.
For this, we ran the following steps (Fig. 1):   

- reading the two samples `.fcs` files
- removing the margin events from each file
- applying compensation for each file
- aggregating and sub-sampling from each file
- estimating the scale transformations from the aggregated 
and sub-sampled data   

```{r scaleTransformQueueDisplay, results='markup', fig.cap="Scale transform processing queue", echo=FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.align='center', fig.wide = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/scaleTransformQueue.png", error = FALSE)
```

After this first part, pre-processing for each file, one by one, was performed.  
However, depending on the choice of QC method, the order of steps
needed to be slightly different (see Fig. 2) : 

```{r preProcessingQueueDisplay, results='markup', fig.cap="Pre-processing queue for two different pipeline settings", echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.wide = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/preProcessingQueues.png", error = FALSE)
```


# Interactive visualizations

## Visualizing pipeline runs at different steps

Using the `CytoPipelineGUI` package, it is possible to interactively inspect
intermediate results produced during the pipeline execution.  

This is done through the `CytoPipelineCheckApp`, which can provide 
a view of the data structure, i.e. the `flowFrame`, 
at any step of any pipeline, as well as a comparison between any the pair of 
`flowFrame` state.

```{r flowframe_viz}
if (interactive()) {
    CytoPipelineGUI::CytoPipelineCheckApp(dir = workDir)    
}
```

It is difficult to extensively demonstrate specific user interactions 
 in a vignette, therefore live demo videos can be found from the `Demo.Rmd` 
 vignette.

However, it is possible to mimic the call to some of the shiny application 
features, by using some specific `CytoPipelineGUI` exported functions. 

A first example below is a function call which retrieves 
the visuals of the workflow of a previously run pipeline:

```{r workflow_viz_prog, out.height=450, out.width=600, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
# pre-processing workflow
expName <- "OMIP021_PeacoQC"
CytoPipelineGUI::plotSelectedWorkflow(
            experimentName = expName,
            whichQueue = "pre-processing",
            sampleFile = sampleFiles[1],
            path = workDir)
```

It is also possible to programmatically obtain comparison plots that 
are displayed within the shiny application.  
Here below is an example, where one is comparing the two pipelines 
(*PeacoQC* vs *flowAI*) after the QC step:

```{r flowframe_viz_prog, out.height=300, out.width=900, fig.height=6, fig.width=18, fig.align='center', message = FALSE}
expName1 <- "OMIP021_PeacoQC"
expName2 <- "OMIP021_flowAI"

p1 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotSelectedFlowFrame(
    experimentName = expName1,
    whichQueue = "pre-processing",
    sampleFile = 2,
    flowFrameName = "perform_QC_obj",
    path = workDir,
    xChannelLabel = "Time : NA",
    yChannelLabel = "FSC-A : NA",
    useAllCells = TRUE,
    useFixedLinearRange = FALSE)

p2 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotSelectedFlowFrame(
    experimentName = expName2,
    whichQueue = "pre-processing",
    sampleFile = 2, 
    flowFrameName = "perform_QC_obj",
    path = workDir,
    xChannelLabel = "Time : NA",
    yChannelLabel = "FSC-A : NA",
    useAllCells = TRUE,
    useFixedLinearRange = FALSE)

p3 <- CytoPipelineGUI::plotDiffFlowFrame(
    path = workDir,
    experimentNameFrom = expName1,
    whichQueueFrom = "pre-processing",
    sampleFileFrom = 2, 
    flowFrameNameFrom = "perform_QC_obj",
    xChannelLabelFrom = "Time : NA",
    yChannelLabelFrom = "FSC-A : NA",
    experimentNameTo = expName2,
    whichQueueTo = "pre-processing",
    sampleFileTo = 2,
    flowFrameNameTo = "perform_QC_obj",
    xChannelLabelTo = "Time : NA",
    yChannelLabelTo = "FSC-A : NA",
    useAllCells = TRUE,
    useFixedLinearRange = FALSE)

p1+p2+p3

```

## Visualization of scale transformations

Besides the flowFrame comparison tool, `CytoPipelineGUI` provides another 
shiny app, which allows to interactively visualize and manage 
the scale transformations that are generated as part of our prep-processing 
pipelines.  

If the shape of the scale transformations that were automatically set by the
chosen algorithm appears to be non satisfactory, it is possible, using this
shiny application, to manually adjust the parameters of the transformation,
and save the results in a RDS object. This object can then be re-used in another
pipeline instance.

```{r scale_transform_viz}
# 5. show scale transformations
if (interactive()){
    CytoPipelineGUI::ScaleTransformApp(dir = workDir)    
}
```

Note that here also, it is possible to obtain the visuals 
of the scale transformations programmatically, 
although this is a bit more evolved, as one has to use `CytoPipeline` functions 
for this.

```{r scale_transform_viz_prog, out.height=300, out.width=600, fig.height=6, fig.width=12, fig.align='center', message = FALSE}
expName <- "OMIP021_PeacoQC"
pipL <- CytoPipeline::buildCytoPipelineFromCache(
    experimentName = expName,
    path = workDir
)

    ff <- CytoPipeline::getCytoPipelineFlowFrame(
        pipL,
        path = workDir,
        whichQueue = "scale transform",
        objectName = "flowframe_aggregate_obj"
    )
    
    p1 <- plotScaleTransformedChannel(
        ff,
        channel = "FSC-A",
        transfoType = "linear",
        linA = 0.0002,
        linB = -0.5)
    
    p2 <- plotScaleTransformedChannel(
        ff,
        channel = "CD3",
        applyTransform = "data",
        transfoType = "logicle",
        t = 262144,
        m = 4.5,
        w = 0.5,
        a = 1.
    )
