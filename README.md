### What is CytoPipelineGUI?

`CytoPipelineGUI` is the companion package of `CytoPipeline`, and is used for
interactive visualization. It implements two shiny applications :
- a shiny app for interactive comparison of flow frames that are the results 
of CytoProcessingSteps of the same or different CytoPipeline experiments.  
It is launched using the following statement: `CytoPipelineCheckApp()`  
- a shiny app for interactive visualization and manual adjustments of scale 
transformation objects. It is launched using the following statement: 
`ScaleTransformApp()`
