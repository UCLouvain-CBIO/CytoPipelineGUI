Description: This package is the companion of the `CytoPipeline` package.
 It provides GUI's (shiny apps) for the visualization of flow cytometry data
 analysis pipelines that are run with `CytoPipeline`.
 Two shiny applications are provided, i.e.
 an interactive flow frame assessment and comparison tool and
 an interactive scale transformations visualization and adjustment tool.
